		No Doubt is an American rock band from Anaheim, California, that formed in 1986 consisting of vocalist Gwen Stefani, guitarist Tom Dumont, bassist Tony Kanal, and drummer Adrian Young. Since 1995, following the departures of keyboardist Eric Stefani and the band's horn section, they have been supported by keyboardist and trumpeter Stephen Bradley and keyboardist and trombonist Gabrial McNair in live performances. The ska sound of their first album No Doubt (1992) failed to make an impact. The Beacon Street Collection (1995) is a raw expression of their sound, inspired by ska punk and released independently by the band under their own record label. The album sold over 100,000 copies in 1995, over three times as many as their first album sold. The band's diamond-certified album Tragic Kingdom (1995) helped launch the third-wave ska revival of the 1990s, and "Don't Speak", the third single from the album, set a record when it spent 16 weeks at the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart.

		The group's next album, Return of Saturn (2000), despite the Top 40 hit single "Simple Kind of Life", did not match the success of their previous but received critical praise and was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 43rd Grammy Awards. 15 months later, the band reappeared with Rock Steady (2001), which incorporated reggae and dancehall music into their work. The album was primarily recorded in Jamaica and featured collaborations with Jamaican artists Bounty Killer, Sly and Robbie, and Lady Saw. The album produced two Grammy-winning singles, "Hey Baby" and "Underneath It All". On 22 November 2002, No Doubt received the Key to the City of Anaheim, given by the Mayor of Anaheim, Tom Daly in Disneyland during the band's appearance on 'Breakfast with Kevin and Bean' (KROQ-FM) where they performed 5 songs. After 2004 tour the band embarked on solo projects, with Gwen Stefani releasing two successful solo albums Love. Angel. Music. Baby. (2004) and The Sweet Escape (2006) while Tom Dumont released his own solo music project, Invincible Overlord. In 2008, the band resumed working slowly on their sixth effort, titled Push and Shove (2012), and released their single "Settle Down". They have sold over 33 million albums worldwide.
