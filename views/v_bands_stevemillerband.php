		Steve Miller Band is an American rock band formed in 1967 in San Francisco, California. The band is managed by Steve Miller on guitar and lead vocals. 
		In 1965, Miller moved to San Francisco where the psychedelic scene was flourishing. He then formed the Steve Miller Blues Band which, when they contracted with Capitol Records in 1967, shortened their name to the Steve Miller Band.

		Billed as The Miller Band, they backed Chuck Berry on his “Live at Fillmore Auditorium” album released that year. In 1968, they released an album, “Children of the Future,” the first in a series of discs rooted solidly in the psychedelic blues style that then dominated the San Francisco scene. Boz Scaggs rejoined Miller for this album and the next one, before starting his own solo career.

		In 1973, “The Joker” marked the start of the second phase of Miller and his band’s career as this work was less hard-rock oriented and simpler in composition. The album received significant radio airplay, which helped the title track reach #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart. The single also hit #1 on the U.K. Singles chart in September 1990 after it was used for a television commercial. The band followed up with “Fly Like an Eagle” in 1976, and “Book of Dreams” in 1977. This pair of albums represented the peak of the group’s commercial career, both reaching the top echelons of the album charts and spawning a lengthy series of hit singles, including “Fly Like An Eagle,” “Rock'n Me,” “Take the Money and Run,” “Jet Airliner” (written by Paul Pena), “Swingtown” and “Jungle Love.”

		They released “Bingo!” in 2010. The album of blues covers was their first in 17 years. In 2011 the Steve Miller Band released the album, “Let Your Hair Down” which, like "Bingo!" was released on Miller’s Space Cowboy Records in partnership with Roadrunner/Loud & Proud Records. For the 2010-2011 school year, Miller was an Artist in Residence at the USC Thornton School of Music, where he taught students in the Popular Music and Music Industry programs.
